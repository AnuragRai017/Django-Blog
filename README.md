   cd django-blog
   ```

8. **Access the Application**

## Configuration

### Settings
- Ensure your `settings.py` has the correct configurations for `STATIC_URL`, `MEDIA_URL`, and other necessary settings.
- Example configurations:
  ```python
  STATIC_URL = '/static/'
  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
  MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']
  ```

### Adding Static Files
- Place your static files in the `static` directory.
- For example, images for backgrounds are located in `static/images/`.

## Content Filtering
The application includes a feature to filter out explicit content. This is implemented in the `forms.py` and `views.py` files where the content is checked against a predefined list of explicit keywords.

## File Structure
- `blogsite/`: The main project directory.
- `blog/`: The app directory containing the blog functionalities.
  - `templates/blog/`: Contains the HTML templates.
  - `static/blog/`: Contains the static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
  - `forms.py`: Defines the forms used in the application.
  - `models.py`: Defines the database models.
  - `views.py`: Contains the view functions for handling HTTP requests.
  - `urls.py`: Defines the URL routes for the application.

## Customizations
### Changing Background Images
To change the background images used in the templates:
1. Place your images in the `static/images/` directory.
2. Update the `style` attributes in the template files to reference the new images.

### Adding New Features
To add new features, follow Django's app structure. Create new models, views, and templates as needed. Update `urls.py` to include the new routes.
